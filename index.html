        <h1> Hello!!! My Name Is Anshika,<br> Today I am Going To Tell About My Hobby Which Is singing! </h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> My favourite hobby is singing and listening to music. Even my voice is not good but I still like to sing. While I listen to music, I feel relax and calm. Singing is an excellent way of entertainment.
            I like to sing because it is fun to sing. I also like to sing because I like to sing with my friends. Singing gives me a great pleasure.
            It helps me to forget my daily problems. Every person has his own favourite groups or singers. My favourite singers are Michael Jackson and Akcent.
            I like to sing very much. I like music. I want to become a good singer. I am working very hard to achieve my goal. I hope one day I will become a great singer.
        </p>

        <h1> Detective conan <br>
            <h2>Detective Conan (名探偵コナン, Meitantei Konan), or Cased Closed is a crime manga series. This comic is written by Gosho Aoyama. The series began in 1994. The manga series has been made into an anime television show. It has been on the air from 1996 to the present time.

                Detective Conan is about a teenage detective named Shinichi Kudo, who is poisoned by an evil group called "The Black Organization". The poison was supposed to kill him. However, the poison instead turned him into a small child. Shinichi adopts a new identity as "Conan Edogawa", and lives with his girlfriend, Ran Mouri, and her father, Detective Kogoro Mori, under the pretense that his parents are away and unable to take care of him. As a child, Shinichi/Conan helps Kogorou solve murder cases, while trying to find the evil men who poisoned him, to steal the poison and create an antidote.

                When Detective Conan first arrived in the United States, the name was changed to Case Closed in English for legal reasons that were never specified.[2] Some of the character names were be changed as well. Shinichi had his first name changed to Jimmy. Ran Mori became Rachel Moore, while her father became Richard. Hiroshi had his first name changed to Hershel. Heiji Hattori became Harley Hartwell. Sonoko Suzuki became Serena Sebastian. Ai Haibara became Anita Hailey. However, Conan kept his Japanese name in English </h2>
